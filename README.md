# Video/Audio Downloader

this is a simple extension that use py (fastapi) for the backend
and react for the frontend. As the title says this extension if you want to call it an extension take video link
(e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) and the file extension
(e.g., MP3, MP4, etc.) and then send a request to the backend which is using yt-dlp with subprocess to download it since it's flexible and returns the raw binary i think so, inside the content, with the file name inside a Content-Disposition, and then use blob in the tsx to read the binary and download it, with the filename from the Content-Disposition. That all üëç
